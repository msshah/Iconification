# Iconification
THIS APP LETS YOU GENERATE Iconset FROM ANY GIVEN PNG AND CREATE .ICNS UNDER OS X.

Iconification is an app written in Java for OS X that creates Iconsets for given images to be used in projects. Simply put, Iconification converts Images into .ICNS files for use in OS X.

SO MANY USERS ON OS X ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT ISSUES REGARDING GENERATING ICNS FILE USING iconutil. PLEASE NOTE, THIS ISSUE IS ONLY CAUSED BY NOT PROVIDING A PROPER PNG IMAGE AS iconutil ON OS X REQUIRES PNG IMAGES SO PROVIDE PNG IMAGE IN PROPER FORMAT. YOU CAN CHANGE RESOLUTIONS BY EDITING THE int ARRAY OF RESOLUTIONS CALLED iRES BUT A GOOD PRACTICE IS, IF YOU'RE USING .ICNS FILE TO CHANGE AN APP OF AN ICON, PLEASE LEAVE THE int ARRAY iRES THE WAY IT IS.

A TEST IMAGE IS PROVIDED NAMED 'IconImage.png'. YOU CAN RUN THIS APP AND DROP THE IMAGE ONTO THE APP, IT WILL GENERATE ICONSET AND .ICNS. THIS IMAGE HAS BEEN TESTED AND IS WORKING PERFECTLY. IF THIS APP GENERATES ICONSET AND ICNS FILE AND YOURS DON'T, THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH YOUR PNG IMAGE.
